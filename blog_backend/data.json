my early years of life, I had few people who inspired and gave me the sense of having ethics and values. To start with, it was my maternal grandparents. Unfortunately for me, my paternal grandparents were gone way before I was born. I have just heard stories of my paternal grandma being an absolute sweetheart, a very loving and caring person.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmma (Maternal Grandma)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;She is the one who introduced me to Quran at an early age in a way that I started to enjoy reading it. She once told me that \" Haq baat karne ke liye chota ya bada hone ki zarurath nahi, sahi hona zaroori hai.\" which means that you can voice out your opinion irrespective of your position, you just need to be righteous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbba (My Father)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI lost him on 10th March 2020, and ever since have missed him in every possible way. He was the one who brought in a lot of discipline in my life. Though I used to feel that he was being too harsh on us. Later I realized that he was laying a strong foundation in my life. There are a couple of things he has instilled in me. Some values that will remain with me forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo of my favorite ones are he asked me to always respect my roots and never forget the state with which we have started our lives. In his opinion, respecting our roots is a way of staying grounded. And the second one is his emphasis on us being strong. He had a Doctorate Degree in Urdu Literature. So he used to quote the below poetry from Allama Iqbal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\" Khudi ko kar buland itna ke har taqder se pehle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKhuda bande se ye poche bata teri raza kya hai\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich means \" Raise yourself to such great heights so, before every destined act, God himself asks what is it you desire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmmi (My Mom)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe is an extremely energetic and a dotting mother. There is always one thing she is known for, is her compassion. Once I questioned her as to why would she care so much for every person around us despite having a job, family, and a tight schedule. She then said something that I want to live up to my entire life. She said \" Living for someone you live, living for yourself is like death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd of course, there were a lot of teachers and relatives who have loved and inspired me a lot.

That was the time we would go to our Nani's place. So this gave us chance to experience staying in a small town.  And fortunately for us, our Nanu and some of our relatives had farms in that town. We would go bonkers during this time, as we had maximum liberty.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike kids these days, who are glued to screens for games. We had all of it in nature. It was a small town, where you could get bikes on rent, run and hop around and build castles in the sand while we also used to play with natural clay. We also build trucks with cardboard and other things available.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the best part was going to the Farmhouse. We had long swings hanging from huge mango trees, water gushing out of huge pipes and we had a small tank at the end of these pipes. Where we would jump around and have fun. We could drink sweet coconut water all day. And run around the farm. We also tried feeding the cattle along with the caretakers. And also used to have a lot of mangoes. Here, let me specify the way we used to eat mangoes. Now, all the mangoes that were ripe and good to eat were put into a bucket full of water. And we used to eat mangoes without cutting them, which made the mangoes tastier for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we had Ammi (my mother) there who used to try to keep us on track by having us complete our holiday homework. And disciplining us to maintain our routine. And 50% of the time she also used to be successful. I'm so grateful that I have such wonderful memories of my childhood.

Always be happy and grateful for all that you have today. You may argue saying that all this is easy to say, but hard when your facing your daily grind. My simple solution for this is writing a gratitude list. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may think how can just jotting down few things that make me feel happy matter. But I challenge you to give it a try and see the results for yourself When you start being grateful, you automatically start looking for positivity. This helps you from preventing yourself to feel mentally and emotionally drained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, let me give a scientific explanation, gratitude can boost neurotransmitter serotonin and activate the brain stem to produce dopamine. Dopamine is our brain's pleasure chemical. The more we think positively about grateful thoughts, the healthier and happier we feel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your a believer who goes by the sacred books then let me give you some context too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\" So remember Me; I will remember you. Be thankful to Me, and never ungrateful.\" - Quran 2:152.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBible Thessalonians 5:18.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word for Gratitude is kṛtajña - which means “recognizing favors that have been done”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLack of gratitude (kṛtaghnam) is said to be the worst sin of all, for which there is no expatriation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkṛtaghnaṁ mahāpātaka dūṣitam - Garuḍa Purāṇa 1,52.24\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nkṛtaghne nāsti niṣkṛtiḥ – there is no expiation for the ungrateful one. - Kish. 34:12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I strongly believe in having an attitude of gratitude as that gives you great satisfaction and inner peace. This in turn helps you be 100% productive. At the same time, I don't claim to be perfect, there are times when I'm feeling low. When you feel so you must constantly remind yourself to be grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading......\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLove and Peace.", "published_date": "2022-02-22T01:47:04Z", "created_at": "2025-01-01T14:05:50.913Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-01T14:21:18.824Z", "cover_pic": null, "description": "", "category": "Personal"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 345, "fields": {"title": "Love my ethnicity💕💕💕", "image": "", "author": "Farheen Zahara", "content": "It is indeed an awesome feeling when you realise that your so much in love with your own ethnicity.

Accepting flaws as a part of life and working on them is a realistic goal that is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me tell you about an instance just after I got married. We stayed together with our in-laws and used to have a lot of conversations. Once, Abbu (my father-in-law) told me that flaws and imperfections in our life are needed to make us complete beings. He gave me the example of jewelry. He said people make such beautiful jewelry by adding impurities to pure gold. That was the first time it occurred to me that flaws are supposed to be accepted. And there was no need to feel disgusted about them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd later I also understood that after accepting our flaws, we need to work on them. But this requires a lot of patience and self-love. We need to understand the fact that everybody sins differently. And that you are not alone. There is no need to talk about your flaws to anybody, but being mindful of them is a good start. Then instead of suppressing them and avoiding them totally, trying to moderate them can be helpful. Get feedback from people who wish good for you and try to work on it. Once you can do that, you can slowly control them.

But I remember one of my cousins telling me that \"you can accomplish all that you want.\" Somehow that thought struck my mind. I have realized a lot of my aspirations, yet working hard on realizing a lot of them. I'm able to relate to the poem by Mirza Ghalib.

Regardless of the success rate, people should never stop believing in themselves and their dreams. But, we get distracted by things that are not in our control.

And we end up being self-critical, having self-doubt, lowering our boundaries to accommodate people, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople tend to behave this way when they are not confident enough to accept themselves the way they are naturally. And it also needs a lot of effort to live life on our terms. We have to agree that we are different and celebrate it while respecting each other.

As a daughter, I feel lucky and blessed to read what my Abba ( my father) had felt when he first saw me in his journal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was an Urdu scholar, hence had used some complicated words to express his feelings. And I had to use a dictionary to understand the passage. Tears are rolling down my cheeks while I write about him, as two years back today, is when he left all of us. He referred to me as \"Naayaab Toufa\" (a precious gift) and as a divine blessing. He writes that it was difficult for him to contain himself, as he held me in his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was always a strict father as I was growing up. Be it sleeping at 8:30 pm to scoring good grades in school. He wanted no compromises in anything that we did in our life. He used to teach Shariya (Islamic way of life). But at times he was overprotective. I still remember he was hesitant to get me a bike when I was in my 10th standard. So, I purposely walked back home from school one day. And I managed to do it at the same time when he was returning from the University. When he asked, \"why was I walking home, and where is the rickshaw ? \". I made a puppy face with big eyes and said I have special classes, so the rickshaw left, all my friends went home on their bikes. The next day he got me a brand new bike with gears, the best one available in the market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut as I grew, he sometimes let me do things on my own. He did a lot of running around and got my admission into the best college in the city. He bought me a two-wheeler(Luna) and took me to a ground(Bal Bhawan in Mysore). He sat behind me and guided me to ride the bike. The second time, he tricked me into believing that he was right behind me. And, I took a long ride. Then I noticed him standing far away, waving at me and telling me that \"I'm doing great, just continue.\"  Abba, you just did the same thing, taught us to be strong and live our lives on our terms. You tricked us into believing that you would always be around and left us. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe made phone calls to all his colleagues at various festivals irrespective of their background. Abba was my first teacher who taught us about inclusiveness, compassion, and tolerance to others' belief systems. Jazakallah Khair Abba, for teaching us to be strong, honest, and humble.

I remember my husband held my hand and shouted with joy, and we were almost tearing up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLife feels the way we want it to feel. It is all about our perception. Yes, you feel stressed and have sleepless nights with busy days. But all of that is nothing compared to the endless joy these little angels bring into our lives.

How many times in a day do we feel lucky or grateful for eating meals every single time we feel hungry? It may not even occur to us, that the food we take for granted can be a luxury for some people. We look for different cuisines and options, and fill full and don't mind wasting food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne-third of the food in the world, 1.3 billion tons every year goes waste. Do we need all these stats to realize that we need to do something about the poverty that we witness so vividly? Is it only the responsibility of organizations like WHO to take care of these issues? Can't we do anything in our power to help poverty? Have we become so heartless that we feel nothing for people dying due to starvation? Millions of such questions keep hitting me with all their strength. We fight wars, play the power game, bomb populated places with nuclear weapons. So when tyrants do their thing, is there nothing we can do to save our mates on this planet? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe even having a nice meal while your neighbor might have been starving also counts as a barbaric act, it is not just the tyrants insensitively bombing all over the world. Don't you feel langar (meal) in Darga and gurudwara, meals in ISKCON temple, and other places of worship make sense in this scenario? It may not completely eradicate poverty. But these acts of generosity as a community shows us the way. A way in which every person can do a bit towards helping our planet get rid of this illness, called poverty. But feeding the starving people is just the first step. The next step to eradicate poverty is enabling people to lead decent lives. And the best way to do this is by education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation is a weapon that brings self-awareness. It is the best way to equip people with skills that can initially help them earn their living. But the role of education extends to teaching values like empathy, love, and compassion.

I reached the airport on time and found all my colleagues were already present. We started our journey by taking selfies. We were eight girls with one kid traveling together from Bangaluru to Mumbai for our meet-up. And how could we miss clicking our gorgeous city (Bengaluru)? It was thrilling to meet our team members from other locations at Mumbai's domestic airport for the first time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had an awesome time traveling on the bus for 3 hours. We played dumb charades and other games while traveling to Lonavala from Mumbai airport. On reaching our destination, I was stoked to see a lush green resort with amenities like a game room, banquet hall, pool, etc... It was an awesome break from the daily grind, where each one of us had a good, relaxing time filled with a lot of fun. We were given a chance to spend time with our teams. Where we played a lot of games and did some fun activities together. It was a quality time spent with our team. When I say \"team\" it refers to everybody at Ajackus, not just the ones we work with daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, this meet-up was not just about fun and enjoyment.

I also won an award for being \"Curious\" in the organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURREAL&nbsp;is how I felt when I was offered a partnership at Ajackus. Regardless of how passionate you are about your work. It always motivates you more when people around you recognize and value your work.

Working with such awesome mates at work is a reward in itself.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe management's vision to provide the best workplace for all the team members working hard for the organization is genuine and sincere.

It could either be good or bad we need to harness it to have a wholesome life. But, when the change is refreshing from your daily grind it fills you up with immense energy. And what could be more refreshing than traveling with friends? And the icing on the cake is that we also kept working while we were on our vacation. So there was no FOMO(Fear Of Missing Out) at work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may sound like a cliche but it is actually true that a lot of people plan to go to Goa but only a few make it. We didn't really have an extensive plan, it was an impulsive decision. One of our friends (Nirmal) the mastermind behind the whole plan couldn't make it, due to some last-minute emergencies. But all of us suddenly just made up our minds and packed our bags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was quite an exciting moment for me as I was going to see both Goa and my office friends for the first time. Due to remote work, we had never seen each other physically before this trip. And, this was also the first time that I was going on a trip all by myself with my friends. With the protective family that I come from, I could have never imagined going all by myself with my friends to vacation. But luckily I'm married to my best friend, who has always encouraged me to live my life to the fullest. The only thing he was really concerned about was my safety, but he is very confident about me. And he also knew almost everybody in the office as he works in the same office too so he was at ease. He feels I can just do about anything on this earth if I make up my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe booked our flights almost at the same time so we could stay together. To be honest, the adrenaline just rushed through my veins to meet my friends at the airport. Well, we got into the car and headed towards south Goa, specifically Agonda beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, being a typical city girl from Bengaluru who hardly gets to see beaches the view of the Agonda beach was breathtaking, I was awestruck. I literally couldn't get my eyes off the wonderful waves and that cool breeze as I stood by the shack to watch it. I was suddenly transported into a whole new world. While my other friends were working to get us all rooms. The room you see in the picture above was my room.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe food at the shack was also lip-smacking, along the view of the waves made me feel surreal. And thanks to our bubbly little darling Bhavya, I got to play with the waves on the beach. We then decided to go on the boat ride just an hour before the sunset. And while the sun was setting we were still in the boat, I could just would sit in the boat and marvel at Allah's creation. The sunset was exquisite, no wonder writers often use sunset while describing a romantic scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome more colleagues and friends later joined us, and there was a live performance in the shack that evening. Technically, that was the first time I had seen a live performance while having dinner and tried hookah under a friend's supervision. It might feel normal to a lot of people, but the family background I came from it was not at all normal. Basically, while growing up we were given all the freedom in things like our studies, choosing our college, the bike we wanted, or the person we want to get married to. But our elders are conservative in other things like traveling with friends or attending any live performance etc. So it was a totally out-of-the-box experience for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a day before we had to leave, while my body had gotten adjusted to the humidity and I no longer had to shower 4 to 5 times a day we traveled to north Goa. We visited our colleagues spend some quality time playing a lot of games and had a lot of fun. We then had been to the famous Baga beach, had dinner, and tried some crazy stuff like karaoke. Goodness!!! Trust me, I was not feeling any older than 18 years old. I was just having so much fun with all of my friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day when we had to leave, we were a little tight on schedule to catch our flight, especially my flight. But it was not me but Maulik who was all tensed, while I was having a fun time with girlies (Bhavya and Kinjal). Maulik took my luggage and rushed to the airport entrance and made sure that I didn't miss the flight. I was touched by this warm caring behavior of Maulik (literally like a family).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been more than a year since we did this, but it feels like it was just yesterday. My heart fills up with warmth and gratitude to everybody who made it to the trip and also to Nirmal who planned it.

And I was also feeling nostalgic as it has been quite sometime since I graduated from my college (GSSS Mysore).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard had a radical proposal for everybody to keep your personal data safe. I agree to the fact that he mentioned that we have chosen convenience over our freedom. And there is actually no privacy in anything that we do today. For example : Making an online payment, or shopping online, or allowing your phone applications to access your data. These are just some examples, but the point is that every time we do any such transaction our data is being used by these service providers for their benefit. These companies also monetize this data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I also consider myself to be a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) girl, I could understand his sentiments. But practically, we are trapped with these online services in a way that we can't really have 100% freedom. We can only try to limit the usage of these services that are stealing all our data. We just have to choose wisely the limit of freedom we are ready to compromise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard also urged the young people gathered there to join FSF(Free Software Foundation) as he feels that, there are many organizations that usefully promote free software, but no other organization stands for software freedom as firmly as the Free Software Foundation.

Maulik has been instrumental in guiding and mentoring me. He has always been pushing me to be my best. His ability to trust me with tasks, to give me creative freedom and a safe space to experiment with things and fail forward worked wonders for me. It has turned my insecurities at work into strengths making me a confident person. He used to often do a lot of brain storming with me and bounce off ideas that have for sure broadened my mental horizon.

But I am very lucky to have supportive manager, mentor who are ready to answer my never ending questions and guide me through my initial days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n At Walmart the core values that they operate on are held very close to heart by all associates. The core values are: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nService to the customer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespect for the individual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrive for excellence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAct with integrity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring onboarding the HR said that , we would see everybody act on these values. And that we would gradually start to act on them, too.

And calls you just to reassure you that you'll be taken care of, you know for sure that you've landed in the right place.  And him putting in those efforts shows  leadership in true sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had a wonderful induction session by the HR. This was followed by a tour of spark square. It is an experiential learning centre that offers the associates a unique and immersive experience to learn about Walmart's history, culture. business, and innovation through exciting knowledge zones. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin this 10 to 11 weeks of me joining Walmart, I have been able to meet a couple of leaders from US. There leaders were such a great influence on me. They were wonderful people who were extremely knowledgeable, but didn't make me feel intimidated as they were very down to earth. They were willing to get on 1 : 1 meetings with us and talk to us about any topic. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, with a positive mind I set my sail into this huge but wonderful organisation.", "published_date": "2023-05-01T14:44:18Z", "created_at": "2025-01-01T14:05:50.965Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-01T14:17:02.848Z", "cover_pic": null, "description": "", "category": "Personal"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 374, "fields": {"title": "Self love is actually self discipline ❤️🏸🏃‍♀️🧘💆", "image": "", "author": "Farheen Zahara", "content": "You might have heard of this phrase \"self love\" quite often these days. It is about prioritising and constantly focusing on improving ourselves. Just working towards  getting better  than what we were yesterday. Recently, I've realised that it's never too late to start practicing self discipline. All it takes is, to be patient with yourself. Have perseverance in the habit that you're trying to build. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need to make good decisions for ourselves all the time. And these decisions should be followed up by actions. Earlier in the day I was watching Ryan Holiday's video about 10 stoic habits. And he  mentioned in the video that everybody knows how to do it but only some people actually do it as they take action. So, stop putting off any of your actions for tomorrow. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd more importantly we need to stop waiting for the perfect time or place or situation. You've got \"now\" in your hands, so just give your hundred percent. You might not be good at something, but that should not matter. As humans, we are not born to be perfect at everything. So, be easy on yourself and consistently practice. It might look tough or nearly impossible in the beginning, but if you remain consistent you are going to achieve your goals sooner or later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, let me give you my example. Three weeks back I decided that I need to stop thinking and start taking some action towards getting healthier and better. I chose to work on my physical, mental as well as emotional health. And this time I told myself that there will be days where I might miss certain activities. But that should not discourage me to move forward. This along with the concept of \"failing forward\" has helped me to be consistent so far. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne needs to realise that everybody is different, and not follow someone or something blindly. When you start your journey for self discipline, at least for a couple of months you need to be ready to experiment. Because, some things that work great for your friends or family may not work fine with you. Let me give you an example, I joined a gym three weeks back, and after a week I realised that working out in a gym is not my thing. I was looking for something different, sustainable and long term. So, I quit gym and started playing badminton 🏸 along with small guided runs from Nike run club. I couldn't continue playing badminton as I didn't have a partner, everytime I wanted to play. But running stayed with me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI definitely started off in a pretty shabby form. I could hardly run, I was rather jogging for a couple of seconds and walking for a minute. I definitely looked like a slow penguin trying to run. But after 5 days of running twice daily, now I can run a little faster and better. Though my form might still not look good. I've decided to stick to running and get better at this every single time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same goes with choosing your diet, you need to figure out what works for you. And you might have to try a couple of things before understanding what works best for your body. Likewise, your decisions to sleep early and wake up early are not at all easy habits but you've got to give yourself a little push and do it anyway. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm at my early stages of building self discipline. But I'm already in love with the whole process, because by just giving up on temporary gratification you can improve the overall quality of life. And also, it is a painful process. But if you train your mind to tolerate this momentary pain you'll be amazed at the way you overcome habits that were causing you to slow down. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the benefits of having self discipline are you can get better spiritually, have more productive work hours, you can focus better, be creative, spend quality time with family, have a healthier body and mind etc. So go for it, and be happy.", "published_date": "2023-05-18T04:40:24Z", "created_at": "2025-01-01T14:05:50.980Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-01T14:16:39.332Z", "cover_pic": null, "description": "", "category": "Personal"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 375, "fields": {"title": "Riding the Wave: The Power of the Adrenaline High in Productivity🏆👩‍💻🏃‍♀️🧘💆🏋️👩‍👧‍👦🏸🥋👩‍❤️‍👨👭🏠👵👴", "image": "", "author": "Farheen Zahara", "content": "Have you ever had one of those days when you're so busy it's exhilarating? Each task flies by in a whirlwind of focus, instead of feeling overwhelming, there's an actual buzz driving you forward. You're juggling multiple projects, participating in co-curricular activities at your workplace, tackling challenges at home, and you feel more attentive, more energized. That's an adrenaline high, and it's quite the productivity booster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdrenaline itself is a fascinating, dual-natured hormone. It's commonly known to fuel our fight-or-flight response during stressful or threatening situations. Yet, taking this chemical out of the emergency context and into our everyday hustle can lead to a thrilling and satisfying kind of busy-ness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Science Behind the High\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdrenaline, or epinephrine, is a hormone released by the adrenal glands. It jump-starts your heart rate, increases breathing, and priming your muscles for action. In essence, it's a temporary supercharge button for your body. And while this shot of energy was initially meant to protect us from predators, it can also rev up our productivity engine when we're dealing with looming deadlines and hefty workloads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI realised this recently, when we had a number of competitions in Walmart Sports League, hackathon etc at the office. It actually made me more active, productive, happy and a satisfied person at the end of the day. As you would have done all of these activities along with completing  your regular work. Another important and useful effect of this high is that you seldom have time to feel low or brood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarnessing the Power of Adrenaline\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA properly channeled adrenaline high can ultra-boost your efficiency, helping you to stay alert, think faster, and work harder. But it's crucial to recognize that this isn't a state to be in perpetually. Too much adrenaline can lead to stress and burnout. Instead, think of it as a natural resource you can tap into sparingly — an energy booster to use when needed. I'm grateful to the management at Walmart who facilitate and engage us in a way that we never feel boredom nor come close to burnout at work. My manager constantly keeps checking on me to make sure that I'm not pressuring myself into doing a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are a few ways how you can harness and sustain this energy:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbrace the Rush\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you notice that adrenaline surge, embrace it instead of panicking. Take a few deep breaths, orient yourself, and start attacking your tasks with renewed energy. The rush that you feel when you have a lot on your plate is actually good, if one can take it in the right spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrioritize\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn adrenaline high can make you feel as if you can do everything at once, but remember to prioritize. Use this energy efficiently by completing high-priority tasks first. And yes, having a priority list for all the tasks that you plan to do always helps. That way you won't end up wasting your time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTake Breaks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough you may feel that you can work continuously, don't dismiss the importance of regular breaks. They help to maintain the balance of adrenaline in the body and prevent burnout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealthy Lifestyle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProper nutrition and regular exercise promote good physical health, ensuring you can handle adrenaline rushes when they occur. Good sleep is also essential for maintaining stress levels and enabling your body to manage adrenaline effectively. Let me give you an example. We had a competition called \"walkathon\" at the office where we were tracking our steps for 21 days and as I took this competition seriously, now I'm in the habit of completing 15000 to 18000 steps daily irrespective of the weather, or situations. These walks are very liberating in nature and help me compose and organise my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPractice Mindful Reflection\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd the day by reflecting on what you've achieved. This will promote a sense of satisfaction and closure, winding down your adrenaline levels in a calm and controlled manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, an adrenaline high pins you in the present, offering a intoxicating blend of speed, focus, and energy. So, the next time you find your schedule filled to the brim, remember: it's not a cause for alarm but an opportunity to ride that wave of adrenaline towards greater productivity and accomplishment.

This facility doesn't just prioritise technological advancements but also emphasises the nurturing of its associates, crafting a workplace that mirrors the enriching environment of top-tier educational spaces. Let's explore how the office culture at Walmart Global Tech embodies the spirit of an Ivy League institution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeding the Future Through Continuous Learning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust like Ivy League universities where learning is a continuous journey, Walmart Global Tech has established a culture that urges its employees to keep evolving intellectually. Knowledge-sharing sessions, workshops, hackathons, mentorship, well-curated courses, both online and offline classes, scope of moving to different departments  and flagship events like converge  are a regular feature, encouraging a dynamic exchange of ideas and fostering a spirit of collaborative learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalmart Global Tech is replete with resources, offering boundless opportunities for exploration and learning.  All the associates here have access to state-of-the-art tools and a plethora of resources, promoting an environment where innovation thrives, and no idea is unattainable. Our direct leader also came up with this amazing idea of master classes and did a mind blowing  introductory interactive session with physical sticky notepads to get us into the groove of continuous learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Oasis of Creativity\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIvy League universities are known for their breathtaking architecture and surroundings that inspire creativity. Walmart Global Tech's office space in Bangalore is designed with an aesthetic appeal, combining modern architecture with green spaces, thereby creating a nurturing habitat for innovation and inspiration.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlongside technical events, there are also initiatives in place to promote physical fitness and overall happiness. This might seem like a lot of fun, but more often it is so much more than just fun for most of us. It is also a refreshing way of not letting yourself experience a burnout amidst the work pressure. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpaces That Respect Individuality\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as Ivy campuses offer quiet zones for introspection and scholarly pursuit, Walmart Global Tech recognises the need for solitary reflection, offering spaces that respect individuality and facilitate deep contemplation and strategic thinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNurturing a Vibrant Community\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraditions play a pivotal role in Ivy League schools, binding individuals in a fabric of shared experiences and camaraderie. Similarly, Walmart Global Tech fosters a rich organisational culture, weaving traditions and rituals that bind its community, fostering a familial spirit that transcends professional boundaries. You will find most of the leaders who are top-notch both from India and the US are almost always willing to connect with you, too. Their kind, caring, witty, knowledgable, and fun company tends to bring out the best in you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWell-being and Mentorship: Pathways to Excellence\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMentorship is a revered tradition in Ivy League institutions, paving the path for future leaders. At Walmart Global Tech, mentorship programs are in place, steering young professionals towards growth and grooming them to be the torchbearers of tomorrow. This helps the associates to get a clear view of the career ladder that they are trying to climb, and also helps them see the blind spots. And in case you feel stuck the mentors help you see the gap and that helps you to take the next steps for you to move to the next level in your career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHolistic Approach to Well-being\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalmart Global Tech adopts an approach, that focuses on the well-being of its associates through initiatives promoting physical health, mental well-being, and a balanced work-life equation. We have sports leagues, competition on walking, cultural fests, and fun Fridays just like an Ivy League institution fosters holistic development. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChallenges\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that associates face no challenges and things are honky dory all the time. Definitely not. Just like in any other place, there are a lot of challenges and difficult conversations faced by the associates. The only difference is just like a top Ivy school there is a strong culture and there are systems and processes that help to ease the difficulties of associates. The associates are encouraged to reach out to any leader or HR in case they are having issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalmart Global Tech in Bangalore isn't just a workspace; it is an ecosystem brimming with potential, a community fostering innovation, learning, and camaraderie, echoing the Ivy League spirit in its true essence. As it continues to evolve, the workspace stands as a beacon of excellence, nurturing not just careers but individuals who are ready to push boundaries, continually grow, and aspire to greater heights. It heralds a future where workspaces are not just about work but about cultivating individuals to their full potential, fostering a culture that is rich, vibrant, and deeply rooted in a spirit of collaboration and communal growth.", "published_date": "2023-09-11T21:05:58Z", "created_at": "2025-01-01T14:05:50.988Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-01T14:16:01.991Z", "cover_pic": null, "description": "", "category": "Personal"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 382, "fields": {"title": "Strive for purposeful productivity instead of busy-ness.🧑‍💻", "image": "", "author": "Farheen Zahara", "content": "A lot of times people glorify themselves and put the other person down who don't seem as busy as them at work. People most often don't understand that for a good performance at work they need to do purposeful and meaningful work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere could be various reasons why some people are not as busy as others at the work place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey might have meticulously planned their work in a way that they don't have to juggle all the time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey might have some good habits like meditation or journaling that might be helping them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey might be wired in a different way than others. They might have different priorities and goals in their life.  For example after completing their tasks at work they might be interested in a lot of other things in life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeep learning and not always being in an execution mood may be their style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOr they might have just been born lucky to stay as cool as a cucumber.😉\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n But I'm lucky that this doesn't cause a lot of damage at my workplace as we do have inspiring leaders who are smart enough to differentiate between busyness and result oriented productivity. For instance our senior director Pradeep Jain insists on us (future leaders) to always try and free our time. He encourages us to pick  topics of our choices and learn. He encourages us to cultivate this learning and growth mindset. He never glorifies busyness, rather encourages us to aim at having result oriented initiatives at hand. All of this amidst maintaining hygiene at our regular work. And never underplays any opportunity where we could have some fun and action. Every session that I have with him, fills me with a lot of positive energy and has helped me set my immediate work goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Under any circumstances, a leader who inspires is never judgemental.\" This was told to me by Rohit Chatter who is my mentor. Just this one statement from my mentor during one of our sessions has changed my way of responding to people. I have stopped reacting, and started pausing before I respond to anybody. On the other hand,  when people stop judging others this whole toxic environment of putting someone down who doesn't seem as busy as you will not exist anymore. Rather, people will be more focused on improving themselves.Firstly, it's pivotal to understand that productivity is an assessment of output, not input. Spending 'n' number of hours at your desk doesn't translate into effective work. It's about accomplishing tasks efficiently and skillfully within office hours. The key is strategic workload management. Prioritize tasks using methods like the Eisenhower Matrix or the Pomodoro Technique, breaking your day into focused sessions interspersed with short breaks. This approach prevents burnout and maintains a consistent performance level.Popular culture glorifies multitasking, but neuroscience disagrees. Studies reveal that task-switching leads to increased errors and time wastage. Instead, mono-tasking, dedicating your attention to a single task at a time, enhances concentration and work quality. By mono-tasking within set time blocks, you're likely to accomplish more in less time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another instance that comes to my mind when I think about prioritising an  overwhelming amount of tasks on hand. We have a culture at our office where though we may not directly report to some seniors, we still gel well. They talk to us and give us insights and a lot of tips. They are so awesome sometimes they notice you feeling down, and without any hesitation walk to you and give you a quick pep talk. One among them is a senior of mine, Santhosh Kolur. He was the one to introduce me to the 80/20 rule. Though I read the book and love the rule. I'm still a novice at practising it (hoping to get better🤞).While modern tech tools are indispensable, they can also be intrusive. Manage technology wisely. Use applications that track and limit time spent on unproductive websites. Leverage collaborative platforms efficiently, setting boundaries by scheduling specific times for checking emails and attending meetings.The glorification of overwork can stem from various sources: peer pressure, skewed reward systems, or personal apprehensions. It's a culture that celebrates being 'busy' as a status symbol. However, it’s vital to recognize that this not only compromises health and well-being but also impairs cognitive functions, leading to diminished work quality. Corporations and leaders need to dismantle this notion and instead foster an environment that equates productivity with smarter work ethics, not longer hours.Incorporating physical activity, adequate hydration, and balanced nutrition during office hours can boost energy levels, concentration, and overall output. Office spaces designed with ergonomic furniture, good lighting, and perhaps a spot of greenery can create a conducive work environment. Maintaining a clear boundary between professional and personal life is crucial. Overcommitting to work can strain relationships and personal growth. Design your work schedule so that it permits quality time for family, hobbies, and rest.In conclusion, the true essence of being productive lies in the balanced orchestration of focused work sessions, healthy lifestyle choices, and personal time. By debunking the glorification of overwork and adopting a more holistic approach, individuals and organizations can ensure a healthier, more sustainable, and indeed, more productive work ethos. The future of work must be anchored in well-being, for it is in the richness of life, not the deprivation of it, that our best work is truly found.", "published_date": "2023-10-23T15:17:36Z", "created_at": "2025-01-01T14:05:51.001Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-01T14:15:41.413Z", "cover_pic": null, "description": "", "category": "Personal"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 383, "fields": {"title": "Farewell Walmart", "image": "", "author": "Farheen Zahara", "content": "A Journey of Growth, Learning, and Cherished Memories\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I prepare to close this significant chapter of my career at Walmart, I am overwhelmed with a mixture of emotions. Reflecting on my journey here, I realise how transformative this experience has been, filled with opportunities for growth, learning, and building cherished memories that will stay with me forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIncredible Mentors and Leaders\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mentors and leaders at Walmart have played an instrumental role in my development. From day one, the unwavering belief in my abilities and the constant encouragement to innovate and strive for excellence shaped my professional journey. I was fortunate to have leaders who not only guided me but also challenged me to think critically and push my boundaries. This support system enabled me to grow both personally and professionally, and for that, I am eternally grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExceptional Colleagues and Team Members\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most rewarding aspects of my time at Walmart has been the opportunity to work with exceptionally talented colleagues and team members. Leading a team of dedicated professionals who put their trust in my leadership was an incredibly fulfilling experience. Their hard work, creativity, and dedication were the driving forces behind our successes. The camaraderie and support from my fellow engineering managers made our collective achievements even more special. The friendships and professional relationships built during this time are invaluable, and I will always treasure them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVisionary Leaders and Inspirational Figures\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollaborating with visionary leaders was a highlight of my career. The complex challenges we navigated together and the innovative solutions we developed were both technically and personally enriching. These leaders' ability to inspire and guide was truly remarkable, and their mentorship left a lasting impact on my approach to problem-solving and leadership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInnovative Teams and Collaborative Projects\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorking with the Gen AI team was an eye-opening experience. Despite being a novice, their patience and expertise made my learning journey with new technologies like LLM both enjoyable and enriching. The collaborative spirit and the environment of growth and innovation they fostered were key to my development. This experience highlighted the importance of continuous learning and adaptability in the fast-evolving tech landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal Growth and New Experiences\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opportunity to work on various projects with the teams was another significant aspect of my time at Walmart. These projects were not only technically challenging but also immensely rewarding. The dedication and expertise of the team made our projects successful and enjoyable, fostering an environment of creativity and innovation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe support and dedication of our technical program managers and product managers were exceptional. Their kindness, patience, and personal touch in every aspect of our work made a significant impact on me. Their guidance and encouragement were a source of strength, and I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such dedicated professionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCherished Moments and Personal Connections\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personal connections made during my time at Walmart are some of the most cherished aspects of my journey. From the early morning calls with colleagues in different time zones to the in-person interactions during visits to India, these moments were truly special. The willingness of colleagues to support and collaborate despite time zone differences demonstrated the strong sense of teamwork and dedication that defines Walmart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReflections and Future Aspirations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I move forward, I carry with me the lessons, memories, and friendships forged during my time at Walmart. This journey has been filled with invaluable experiences that have shaped me both personally and professionally. I have learned the importance of resilience, adaptability, and continuous learning. I have grown not only as a professional but also as a person, thanks to the incredible people I have had the privilege to work with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaving Walmart is bittersweet. While I am excited about the new opportunities and adventures that lie ahead, I will always look back on my time here with fondness and gratitude. The experiences and relationships I have built will continue to inspire and guide me in my future endeavors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you, Walmart, for making this chapter of my life so unforgettable.

Writing is something I’ve dearly missed while I've been occupied with settling into a new place. The thrill of sharing stories and updates with you all is truly unmatched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's always been my wish to explore new places, take on new challenges, and get exposed to different cultures and people from various geographical areas. However, like many Indian girls of my age, I completed my graduation, got married immediately, and soon after had babies one after another. I somehow juggled all these responsibilities, managing a career while also securing a place in my in-laws' hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, when your eldest child hits their 13th birthday, it hits you hard. You realize that in the midst of all these events, you have almost forgotten yourself. As I approach my late 30s, this awakening is even more profound, prompting me to reflect on the dreams and aspirations I once had. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this moment, it feels like a blessing in disguise to have a supportive husband who turns my dreams into our shared goals. Our children, eager to contribute, join forces to maintain our family's harmony and status quo, while allowing me the freedom to pursue my aspirations. Alhamdulillah, this fills me with immense joy and a renewed sense of purpose, making me feel like the happiest girl ready to conquer the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompanion for my morning walk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe every place has its own unique charm, with its own set of pros and cons. I prefer to embrace and enjoy the distinctiveness and experiences of different locations rather than being judgmental. For instance, while the extreme weather here in Dubai might be a shock for someone from Bangalore, I found joy in the hot summer, feeling as though it was an open sauna every time I stepped outside. I particularly appreciate the white sand here in Dubai.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike many tourists who rush to see famous landmarks, I chose to live in an older area where I could experience life alongside the natives, as well as Indians and Pakistanis. There is a unique joy in maintaining a low profile, allowing yourself to learn, grow, and savor the little moments. Whether it's playing with kiddos at the park and beating them at badminton, meeting strangers during walks and getting to know them, or living in an apartment with girls from all over the world—Algeria, Nigeria, India (Surat), Pakistan, and of course, Kerala.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the amusing aspects I’ve noticed is that almost every other supermarket here is owned by a Malayali (people from Kerala). With a smile, the first thing they ask me upon seeing me is, \"Are you from Kerala?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTiramisu \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of our flatmates from Algeria recently prepared a delicious tiramisu. It was absolutely delightful! We often celebrate happy moments with little gestures like this. Happiness can stem from various reasons, whether it's cracking a job interview, someone getting proposed to by their partner, or someone receiving a promotion. These small celebrations bring us closer and make our shared experiences even more special. Apart from this I also used to have cousin's get together once on the weekends for a wonderful cup of ginger lemon tea with honey at a Cafe. The tea was honestly very good along with such good company used to brighten me. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut beyond all this, the most significant aspect is having the bandwidth to reflect and focus on yourself. When you're juggling multiple responsibilities, it's easy to overlook self-care. When you get an opportunity like this, the best way to leverage it, in my opinion, is to first conduct a thorough assessment of where you stand spiritually, mentally, physically, and emotionally. Then, systematically work on optimizing each aspect every single day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere might be a latent creative streak in you that you've been putting on the back burner for a long time, and now is the ideal time to cultivate it. Reconnecting with your passions and interests can be incredibly rewarding, enabling you to grow and evolve in ways you may have previously underestimated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally a lot of love and peace to all my readers. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️", "published_date": "2024-08-03T15:39:25Z", "created_at": "2025-01-01T14:05:51.021Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-01T14:14:37.967Z", "cover_pic": null, "description": "", "category": "Personal"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 418, "fields": {"title": "Hobbies", "image": "blog_images/08d71-img_20180326_105914_01.jpg", "author": "Anonymous", "content": "Banana fruit cake\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHand stitched dress for my little one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRandom Drawing with my daughter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPink pasta with toasted bread\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHand stitched dress for my little one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHand stitched bed for my little one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRandom Drawing with my daughter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDoormat with old track pants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHand stitched dress for my little one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHand stitched dress for my little one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHome Gardening on a small scale.", "published_date": "2022-02-22T11:12:36Z", "created_at": "2025-01-01T14:27:17.669Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-02T09:03:50.535Z", "cover_pic": null, "description": "", "category": "Tech"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 483, "fields": {"title": "Self love is actually self discipline ❤️🏸🏃‍♀️🧘💆", "image": "", "author": "Anonymous", "content": "<!-- wp:image {\"id\":517,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/static/images/project_images/52542-its-not-how-bad-you-want-it.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-517\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You might have heard of this phrase \"self love\" quite often these days. It is about prioritising and constantly focusing on improving ourselves. Just working towards  getting better  than what we were yesterday. Recently, I've realised that it's never too late to start practicing self discipline. All it takes is, to be patient with yourself. Have perseverance in the habit that you're trying to build. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We need to make good decisions for ourselves all the time. And these decisions should be followed up by actions. Earlier in the day I was watching Ryan Holiday's video about 10 stoic habits. And he  mentioned in the video that everybody knows how to do it but only some people actually do it as they take action. So, stop putting off any of your actions for tomorrow. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And more importantly we need to stop waiting for the perfect time or place or situation. You've got \"now\" in your hands, so just give your hundred percent. You might not be good at something, but that should not matter. As humans, we are not born to be perfect at everything. So, be easy on yourself and consistently practice. It might look tough or nearly impossible in the beginning, but if you remain consistent you are going to achieve your goals sooner or later.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, let me give you my example. Three weeks back I decided that I need to stop thinking and start taking some action towards getting healthier and better. I chose to work on my physical, mental as well as emotional health. And this time I told myself that there will be days where I might miss certain activities. But that should not discourage me to move forward. This along with the concept of \"failing forward\" has helped me to be consistent so far. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One needs to realise that everybody is different, and not follow someone or something blindly. When you start your journey for self discipline, at least for a couple of months you need to be ready to experiment. Because, some things that work great for your friends or family may not work fine with you. Let me give you an example, I joined a gym three weeks back, and after a week I realised that working out in a gym is not my thing. I was looking for something different, sustainable and long term. So, I quit gym and started playing badminton 🏸 along with small guided runs from Nike run club. I couldn't continue playing badminton as I didn't have a partner, everytime I wanted to play. But running stayed with me. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I definitely started off in a pretty shabby form. I could hardly run, I was rather jogging for a couple of seconds and walking for a minute. I definitely looked like a slow penguin trying to run. But after 5 days of running twice daily, now I can run a little faster and better. Though my form might still not look good. I've decided to stick to running and get better at this every single time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The same goes with choosing your diet, you need to figure out what works for you. And you might have to try a couple of things before understanding what works best for your body. Likewise, your decisions to sleep early and wake up early are not at all easy habits but you've got to give yourself a little push and do it anyway. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm at my early stages of building self discipline. But I'm already in love with the whole process, because by just giving up on temporary gratification you can improve the overall quality of life. And also, it is a painful process. But if you train your mind to tolerate this momentary pain you'll be amazed at the way you overcome habits that were causing you to slow down. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So the benefits of having self discipline are you can get better spiritually, have more productive work hours, you can focus better, be creative, spend quality time with family, have a healthier body and mind etc. So go for it, and be happy. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->", "published_date": "2023-05-18T04:40:24Z", "created_at": "2025-01-01T14:38:16.069Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-01T14:38:16.069Z", "cover_pic": null, "description": null, "category": "Tech"}}, {"model": "blog.blog", "pk": 484, "fields": {"title": "Riding the Wave: The Power of the Adrenaline High in Productivity🏆👩‍💻🏃‍♀️🧘💆🏋️👩‍👧‍👦🏸🥋👩‍❤️‍👨👭🏠👵👴", "image": "", "author": "Anonymous", "content": "<!-- wp:image {\"id\":465,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/static/images/project_images/pexels-photo-3765155.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-465\" /></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Have you ever had one of those days when you're so busy it's exhilarating?

You're juggling multiple projects, participating in co-curricular activities at your workplace, tackling challenges at home, and you feel more attentive, more energized. That's an adrenaline high, and it's quite the productivity booster.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Adrenaline itself is a fascinating, dual-natured hormone. It's commonly known to fuel our fight-or-flight response during stressful or threatening situations. Yet, taking this chemical out of the emergency context and into our everyday hustle can lead to a thrilling and satisfying kind of busy-ness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Science Behind the High</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Adrenaline, or epinephrine, is a hormone released by the adrenal glands. It jump-starts your heart rate, increases breathing, and priming your muscles for action. In essence, it's a temporary supercharge button for your body. And while this shot of energy was initially meant to protect us from predators, it can also rev up our productivity engine when we're dealing with looming deadlines and hefty workloads.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I realised this recently, when we had a number of competitions in Walmart Sports League, hackathon etc at the office.

Another important and useful effect of this high is that you seldom have time to feel low or brood.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Harnessing the Power of Adrenaline</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A properly channeled adrenaline high can ultra-boost your efficiency, helping you to stay alert, think faster, and work harder. But it's crucial to recognize that this isn't a state to be in perpetually. Too much adrenaline can lead to stress and burnout. Instead, think of it as a natural resource you can tap into sparingly — an energy booster to use when needed. I'm grateful to the management at Walmart who facilitate and engage us in a way that we never feel boredom nor come close to burnout at work. My manager constantly keeps checking on me to make sure that I'm not pressuring myself into doing a lot.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are a few ways how you can harness and sustain this energy:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Embrace the Rush</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you notice that adrenaline surge, embrace it instead of panicking. Take a few deep breaths, orient yourself, and start attacking your tasks with renewed energy. The rush that you feel when you have a lot on your plate is actually good, if one can take it in the right spirit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prioritize</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An adrenaline high can make you feel as if you can do everything at once, but remember to prioritize. Use this energy efficiently by completing high-priority tasks first. And yes, having a priority list for all the tasks that you plan to do always helps. That way you won't end up wasting your time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Take Breaks</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although you may feel that you can work continuously, don't dismiss the importance of regular breaks. They help to maintain the balance of adrenaline in the body and prevent burnout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Healthy Lifestyle</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Proper nutrition and regular exercise promote good physical health, ensuring you can handle adrenaline rushes when they occur. Good sleep is also essential for maintaining stress levels and enabling your body to manage adrenaline effectively. Let me give you an example. We had a competition called \"walkathon\" at the office where we were tracking our steps for 21 days and as I took this competition seriously, now I'm in the habit of completing 15000 to 18000 steps daily irrespective of the weather, or situations. These walks are very liberating in nature and help me compose and organise my thoughts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Practice Mindful Reflection</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>End the day by reflecting on what you've achieved.
